## uses P5.js-vite Starter Template ðŸš€

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) starter template to scaffold a new [p5.js](https://p5js.org) project.

This is an unopinionated template; aside from P5.js and Vite, the rest of your project's tools are entirely up to you.


## npm scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts the development server at port [3000](http://localhost:3000/)
- `npm run build` - Builds the application in a `dist` folder
- `npm run preview` - Serves the build files (`dist` folder) locally at port [5000](http://localhost:3000/)

Note that if after this last command you do not see anything, you can use instead this other command:

- `npm run preview --host` - You should then be able to see your files locally at port [5000](http://localhost:3000/)
